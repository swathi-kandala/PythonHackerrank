1. Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:
If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

n = int(raw_input())
if n%2 !=0:
    print "Weird"
elif n%2==0 and 2<=n<=5:
    print "Not Weird"
elif n%2==0 and 6<=n<=20:
    print "Weird"
else:
    print "Not Weird"


2. Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:
The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(raw_input())
    b = int(raw_input())
    print a+b
    print a-b
    print a*b
    
    
3. Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division. The second line should contain float division

from __future__ import division
if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = int(raw_input())
    b = int(raw_input())
    print a//b
    print a/b
    
    
4. Read an integer N. For all non-negative i<N integers, print i^2

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    for i in range(0,n):
        print i*i
        
        
5. Read an integer n.
Without using any string methods, try to print the following: 12345...n

from __future__ import print_function
if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    print(*range(1,n+1), sep='')
    
    
6. You are given three integers x, y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer N. You have to print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to N. Here, 0<=i<=x, 0<=j<=y and 0<=k<=z

if __name__ == '__main__':
    x = int(raw_input())
    y = int(raw_input())
    z = int(raw_input())
    n = int(raw_input())
    print [[i,j,k] for i in range(0,x+1) for j in range(0,y+1) for k in range(0,z+1) if i+j+k!=n]


7. Given the participants' score sheet for your University Sports Day, you are required to find the runner-up score. You are given scores. Store them in a list and find the score of the runner-up

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(raw_input())
    arr = map(int, raw_input().split())
    print sorted(list(set(arr)))[-2]
